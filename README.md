# salsify-takehome

In this updated version, I made some personalized changes to the original bar. :)

### Updates:

1. The progress bar will update as the user types in the input bar. The event listener is listening for any key ups. 

2. After the user clicks the 'Run' button, the progress will update in purple. This is to show the contrast between the initially updated bar and the bar as it runs. 

3. There is a message that displays the current percentage as the progress bar runs.
